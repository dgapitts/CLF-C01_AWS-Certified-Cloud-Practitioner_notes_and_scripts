# CLF-C01 AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner notes and sample code


I'm making some notes and sample code, as I prepare for the CLF-C01 exam.

* Lab01 - [Introducing lambda - my first function](docs/intro-lamdba.md)
* Lab02 - [Introducing VPC with a Publis Subnet plus Route Table with an Internet Gateway and an EC2 instance](docs/intro-vpc.md)
* Lab03 - [Introducing - CloudFormation and DynamoDB](docs/Intro-CloudFormation-DynamoDB.md)
* Lab04 - [Intro to IAM with a Custom Policy, User Group and User Assignment](docs/intro-iam-policies-groups-users.md)


I also did some extra research 

* [IAM setup for EC2 basic CLI admin](docs/extra-EC2-basic-admin.md) 
* [Intro to aws cli to start and stop ec2 nodes](docs/intro-aws-cli-ec2.md)
